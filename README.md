### 🚀 About Me

* 📚 **Education:** Computer Engineering at UNAM.
* 🧠 **Interests:** Robotics, artificial intelligence, and software development.
* [cite_start]💡 **Activities:** Active member of the robotics club (CROFI) and the AI society (SIAFI)[cite: 6, 22]. [cite_start]I also serve as an independent instructor for math and logical reasoning[cite: 16, 19].
* [cite_start]🌎 **Focus:** I am passionate about applying my knowledge in practical environments to design, prototype, and test complex systems that integrate hardware and software[cite: 14].

### 🏆 Featured Projects

* **Multi-Modal Transit Route Optimizer (CDMX)**:
    * [cite_start]I modeled Mexico City's public transit network as a weighted graph [cite: 31] [cite_start]and implemented Dijkstra's algorithm (`heapq`) to find the optimal route, handling dynamic fares and station closures[cite: 32, 33].

* **Financial Modeling and Visualization Tool**:
    * [cite_start]I developed an Object-Oriented tool to calculate and project investment returns (compound interest, inflation) [cite: 36] [cite_start]using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** for data visualization and export[cite: 37].

* **Club Projects (CROFI & SIAFI)**:
    * [cite_start]**Line-Following Robot:** Designed and built an autonomous robot capable of navigating predefined paths using infrared sensors and control algorithms[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]**AI NPC Teacher:** Developed an interactive NPC in Unity (VRChat) using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face for contextual chatbot functionality[cite: 25].
    * [cite_start]**Home Security System:** Prototyped a system with multiple sensors (motion, noise, temp), password-based access control, and an alert system[cite: 15].
