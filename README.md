### 🏆 Featured Projects

* **Multi-Modal Transit Route Optimizer (CDMX)**:
    * I modeled Mexico City's public transit network as a weighted graph and implemented Dijkstra's algorithm (`heapq`) to find the optimal route, handling dynamic fares and station closures.

* **Financial Modeling and Visualization Tool**:
    * I developed an Object-Oriented tool to calculate and project investment returns (compound interest, inflation) using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** for data visualization and export.

* **Club Projects (CROFI & SIAFI)**:
    * **Line-Following Robot:** Designed and built an autonomous robot capable of navigating predefined paths using infrared sensors and control algorithms.
    * **AI NPC Teacher:** Developed an interactive NPC in Unity (VRChat) using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face for contextual chatbot functionality.
    * **Home Security System:** Prototype with multiple sensors (motion, noise, temp), password-based access control, and an alert system.
